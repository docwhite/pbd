# Position Based Dynamics

![Implementation][jakobsen/image.png]

Implementation of constraint-based verlet solvers explained by Jakobsen's
[Advanced Character Physics](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15462-s13/www/lec_slides/Jakobsen.pdf)
and Muller's [Position Based Dynamics](http://matthias-mueller-fischer.ch/publications/posBasedDyn.pdf).

You can play with the Jakobsen-style [demo](docwhite.github.io/pbd), the source
code is under **/jakobsen** folder in this [repository](https://github.com/docwhite/pbd).
